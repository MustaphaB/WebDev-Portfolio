      			<span>People smile and tell me I'm the lucky one</span>
				<span>And we've just begun</span>
				<span>I think I'm gonna have a son</span>
				<span>He will be like him and me, as free as a dove</span>
				<span>Conceived in love</span>
				<span>The sun is gonna shine above</span>

    		  <p class="spacing fwb">
      			<span>And even though we ain't got money</span>
				<span>I'm so in love with you honey</span>
				<span>Everything will bring a chain of love</span>
				<span>And in the morning when I rise</span>
				<span>Bring a tear of joy to my eyes</span>
				<span>And tell me everything's gonna be all right</span>

    		<p class="spacing fwi">
      			<span>Love a guy who holds the world in a </span>
				<span>paper cup</span>
				<span>Drink it up</span>
				<span>Love him and he'll bring you luck</span>
				<span>And if you find he helps your mind, </span>
				<span>better take him home</span>
				<span>Yeah, and don't you live alone</span>
				<span>Try to earn what lovers own</span>
