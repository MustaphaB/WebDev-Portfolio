				<p class="aboutPara1"><b>The Human Genome Project (HGP)</b> was an international scientific research project with the goal of determining the base pairs that make up human DNA, and of identifying and mapping all of the genes of the human genome from both a physical and a functional standpoint</p>


				<p class="aboutPara2">The main goals of the Human Genome Project were first articulated in 1988 by a special committee of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, and later adopted through a detailed series of five-year plans jointly written by the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Energy.</p>

					<p class="h">1994 - An international team of researchers has published a detailed linkage map of the human genome, meeting one of the project's scientific goals a full year ahead of schedule. </p>
					<p class="h">1996 - The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) recently launched its first, full-throttle attempt to decipher human DNA - a process called DNA sequencing - by awarding funds to scientists at six U.S. institutions. </p>

					<p class="h">2000 - two billion of the three billion "letters" that constitute the genetic instruction book of humans have been deciphered and deposited into GenBank.</p>
					<p class="h">2003 - Completion of the Human Genome Project. Scientists are moving on to sequencing other organism. NIH grants 36 million to mapping all genomes that are crucial to biological functions</p>
					<p class="h">2004 - The National Human Genome Research Institute announces that the International Sequencing Consortium (ISC) has launched a free, online resource where scientists and the public can get the latest information on the status of sequencing projects for animal, plant and other eukaryotic genomes.</p>

				<p class="aboutPara1">At the onset of the Human Genome Project several ethical, legal, and social concerns were raised in regard to how increased knowledge of the human genome could be used to discriminate against people.</p>


				<p class="aboutPara2">One of the main concerns of most individuals was the fear that both employers and health insurance companies would refuse to hire individuals or refuse to provide insurance to people because of a health concern indicated by someone's genes.</p>

				<p class="aboutPara2">In 1996 the United States passed the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) which protects against the unauthorized and non-consensual release of individually identifiable health information to any entity not actively engaged in the provision of healthcare services to a patient</p>

		<div class="impactPara">
				<p class="aboutPara1">The HGP has revealed that there are probably about 20,500 human genes. This ultimate product of the HGP has given the world a resource of detailed information about the structure, organization and function of the complete set of human genes. This information can be thought of as the basic set of inheritable "instructions" for the development and function of a human being.</p>


				<p class="aboutPara2">The tools created through the HGP also continue to inform efforts to characterize the entire genomes of several other organisms used extensively in biological research, such as mice, fruit flies and flatworms. These efforts support each other, because most organisms have many similar, or "homologous," genes with similar functions. Therefore, the identification of the sequence or function of a gene in a model organism, for example, the roundworm C. elegans, has the potential to explain a homologous gene in human beings, or in one of the other model organisms. </p>
