	<ul>
		<li>
			I like the choices of images to use, the one possible decision choice you could think
			about is maybe tying up more of the background for the images.

		</li>
		<li>
			Think about how you could do stylistic changes to make the text pop out, for example
			with the skinny and pale, you could somehow make the text skinnier to emphasize that point
				
		</li>
		<li>
			For the desktop images think about the spacing of the words.
				
		</li>
		<li>
			For some images you could make color choices according to what the person/people are 
			wearing in the cutouts/images.
			
		</li>
		<li>
			Add the source of the quotes as well as quotations. For the most part I feel like your 
			line breaks work really well
